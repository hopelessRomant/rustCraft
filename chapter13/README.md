# Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures
Rust’s design has taken inspiration from many existing languages and techniques, and one significant influence is *functional programming*. Programming in a functional style often includes using functions as values by passing them in arguments, returning them from other functions, assigning them to variables for later execution, and so forth.

In this chapter, we won’t debate the issue of what functional programming is or isn’t but will instead discuss some features of Rust that are similar to features in many languages often referred to as functional.

More specifically, we’ll cover:

1. Closures, a function-like construct you can store in a variable
2. Iterators, a way of processing a series of elements
3. How to use closures and iterators to improve the I/O project in Chapter 12
4. The performance of closures and iterators (spoiler alert: they’re faster than you might think!)

We’ve already covered some other Rust features, such as pattern matching and enums, that are also influenced by the functional style. Because mastering closures and iterators is an important part of writing idiomatic, fast Rust code, we’ll devote this entire chapter to them.

## Closure Traits
The way a closure captures and handles values from the environment affects which traits the closure implements, and traits are how functions and structs can specify what kinds of closures they can use. Closures will automatically implement one, two, or all three of these `Fn` traits, in an additive fashion, depending on how the closure’s body handles the values:

1. `FnOnce` applies to closures that can be called once. All closures implement at least this trait because all closures can be called. A closure that moves captured values out of its body will only implement FnOnce and none of the other Fn traits because it can only be called once.
2. `FnMut` applies to closures that don’t move captured values out of their body, but that might mutate the captured values. These closures can be called more than once.
3. `Fn` applies to closures that don’t move captured values out of their body and that don’t mutate captured values, as well as closures that capture nothing from their environment. These closures can be called more than once without mutating their environment, which is important in cases such as calling a closure multiple times concurrently.
