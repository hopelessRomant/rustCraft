## Recap of the project
1. We can create a project using cargo new.
2. We can build a project using cargo build.
3. We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run.
4. We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.
5. Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.
6. When your project is finally ready for release, you can use cargo build --release to compile it with optimizations.
