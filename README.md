# Rust Learning Projects

This repository documents my journey through the official [*Rust Programming Language Book*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), containing code examples, exercises, and small projects that I’ve built while learning Rust. Each file or module in this repository corresponds to specific Rust concepts covered in the book — from ownership and lifetimes to concurrency, error handling, and systems-level design patterns.

## Purpose and Motivation

My primary motivation for learning Rust is to develop high-performance, low-latency systems that can power **trade execution bots** and **Web3 transaction signing services**.
These domains demand:

* **Speed:** Sub-millisecond decision-making and execution.
* **Reliability:** Memory safety without sacrificing performance.
* **Security:** Robust protection against vulnerabilities common in concurrent and cryptographic systems.

Rust’s design philosophy — *fearless concurrency, zero-cost abstractions, and strict memory guarantees* — aligns perfectly with these requirements. This repository, therefore, doubles as both:

1. A record of my progress through the Rust ecosystem.
2. A curated set of core Rust features that are essential for building performant trading and blockchain infrastructure.

## Structure

Each directory corresponds to a chapter or concept from the Rust Book and includes:

* **Code examples** rewritten or extended for practical relevance.
* **Notes and insights** linking language concepts to real-world applications in low-latency and decentralized systems.
* **Mini-projects** demonstrating foundational skills that will be later applied in production-grade Rust systems.
